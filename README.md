## Description:

- The proposed Drupal module, for instance, is aimed primarily at making a conscientious use of the Affiliate Network and its shared advancements, specifically by acquiring the services of the Affiliate API, in this case, and integrating its mechanism with the Drupal 8 architecture. In layman terms, the finished module would pull in latest product specifications, reviews and additional data selected by the customer, and import them into their Drupal site as nodes, without the hassle of manually updating product feeds, which can then be used by a customer according to his/her requirements.

- This would be due to the fact that the data would be directly imported from reliable and prominent affiliate networks such as Amazon and Flipkart, to name a few, through the affiliate link facilitated by the API, thereby tracking the referral link to a particular e-commerce platformâ€™s site through a cookie or pixel.

- This module allows the developers to extend its functionality by providing different plugins to it. E.g product_advertising_api_amazon helps a publisher to integrate Amazon product advertising api with Drupal. Similarly product_advertising_api_flipkart helps to integrate with Flipkart product advertising api.  Apart from it, the module will be providing a fallback scraper api to fetch data in case there is no api provided by an ecommerce site.

- Some use cases of the functionalities that will be provided by our module can be seen on some live websites like  products compare engines ( MysmartPrice, NexTag ) , niche review sites ( Trip Advisor ), and blogs (headphonereview.com, techradar.com).
